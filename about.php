                            We charge a one time set-up fee of $100 per person per move-in that includes basic kitchen and bath supplies. There is also the option to purchase upgraded move in packages at our members’ discretion. Occasionally we offer some premium events at a small fee, but most times events are free. Please inquire with the onsite team regarding pet fees.         </p>

                            For leased apartments there is a once a month in-room cleaning included in your membership. They will clean surfaces, sweep, mop, remove garbage and change your sheets if you leave a fresh set. We hope to offer additional cleanings as a service in the future, but if you have a house cleaning service you’d like to come more often we can give them access at your request.

                            For nightly stay we will clean prior to arrival. We can offer additional cleanings by request. For nightly stay guests staying 7+ days, a once a week cleaning is included free of charge by request.

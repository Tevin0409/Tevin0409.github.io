        <p>The purpose of TheVlage is to create a home environment that inspires and empowers its residents to be active
            creators and participants in the world around them.
            These environments cultivate collaboration and serendipity among residents and the extended community.

                    The Vlage prides itself on providing a fully private, beautiful and comfortable space for our members.
                    That said, The Vlage is also focused on connecting you to your neighbors again.
                    Through our events, common spaces and on site team there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with the The Vlage community.

                    The Vlage Wall Street offers nightly stay starting from one night up to a month.
                    Both The Vlage Wall Street and The Vlage Crystal City offer leases for as little as one month and as long as a year.

                <p>
                    While we do offer nightly stay in New York, The Vlage is not a full service hotel nor is it a hostel where you will be paired up with strangers.
                    If you book with us in nightly stay you will be booking the full apartment to yourself, but you will have the opportunity to engage with our community through our events and common spaces.

                    Unfortunately at this time The Vlage does not match roommates.
                    The Vlage units are rented as an apartment and not by the room so if you are interested in a multi-bed apartment please bring your friends.

                    We offer studio apartments to four bedrooms.
                    Every apartment has a refrigerator and some kitchen appliances.
                    Every apartment has at least one full bathroom, but typically our multi-bed units have 1.5 to 2 bathrooms.
                    Your apartment will come equipped with a flat screen TV and ceiling mounted speakers.
